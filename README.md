# Map Visualizer and Route Planner

This C++ project is designed to visualize maps exported from OpenStreetMap and create routes between selected points on the map. The program converts `.osm` map data into a graph of nodes and edges, which is then visualized using SFML 3.0.0. The map data is parsed using RapidXML, and the graph is rendered as `VertexArray::Lines`. The project supports parsing multiple `.osm` files, and the data is stored in a binary format for faster loading in subsequent runs.

## Features

- **Map Visualization**: Convert `.osm` map data into a graph and visualize it using SFML.
- **Multiple Map Files**: Parse and merge multiple `.osm` files into a single graph.
- **Binary Data Storage**: Store parsed map data in binary format for quick loading.
- **Interactive Map**: Zoom, pan, and resize the map window.
- **Efficient Rendering**: Use a quadtree to render only the visible edges, ensuring smooth performance at 60 FPS.
- **Route Planning**: Calculate the shortest path between two points using the A* algorithm.
- **Haversine Distance**: Compute route distances using the Haversine formula and print them to the terminal.
- **CMake Build System**: Automatically downloads and links SFML during compilation.

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler**: Supports C++20 or later.
- **CMake**: Version 3.14 or later.
- **SFML**: Version 3.0.0 (automatically downloaded during build).
- **RapidXML**: Header-only library included in the project.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joonaMakiKorte/MapViewer.git
   cd MapViewer
   ```

2. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

3. **Run the Program**:
   ```bash
   ./MapViewer
   ```

## Usage

- **Loading Maps**: Place your `.osm` files in the `maps` directory. The program will automatically load and merge them into a single graph.
- **Navigating the Map**:
  - **Zoom**: Use the mouse scroll wheel.
  - **Pan**: Click and drag the map.
  - **Resize**: Adjust the window size.
- **Creating Routes**: Click on two points on the map to calculate and visualize the shortest path between them. The route distance will be printed in the terminal.
